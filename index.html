						<h2 class="major">My Interest In Information Technology</h2>
						<p>My interest in IT is mainly driven by the need to imporve the world. Everyday I see issues I believe there are not too complicated solutions
							for yet are not even being addressed. I don't believe there was ever an event that sparked this passion as I feel I have being really interested in IT
							my entire life.</p>
						<p>I chose to study with RMIT as I have heard and seen that they are one of the best Universities in the world for engineering and IT. Even though Geographically speaking
							RMIT was a good option for me their online studies through OUA really makes them stand out.</p>
						<p>I am hoping to learn skills applicable to team related work. These would include group management, work flow,
							conflict resolution and more. I also am excited to learn about GitHub as I never understood how powerful and amazing of a program it is. </p>

						<h3>The Job Advertisment</h3>
						<a href="#" class="image"><img src="http://i67.tinypic.com/ae5de1.png" alt="" /></a>
						<br>
						<br>
						<h3>The postion and how it is appealing to me</h3>
						<p> This is a very versatile role that that comprises of many elements making it an interesting and constatly challenging role. Jobs that have more than
							one task appeal to me as they can keep me interested in my work. </p>
						<br>
						<h3>Skills required for this job</h3>
						<p>Understanding of PC hardware
							<br>Understanding of all operating systems
							<br>Experience in a variety of server technologies
							<br>Elite troubleshooting Skills
							<br>A broad understanding of computer security and procedures
							<br>Strong communication skills
							<br>Well presented
						</p>
						<br>
						<h3>The skills I believe I already have</h3>
						<p> I believe my understanding of PC hardware, communications skills and prensentaion are strong. I lack the more "hard" computer skills that would be required.</p>
						<br>
						<h3>How i will obtain these sklls</h3>
						<p> Continuing my studies and broadening my knowledge is currently the smartest direction for myself. After several more years of study and from obtaining experience
							I believe I will develop the neccassy skills required for such a job. I find it hard to pin point exactly how I may obtain each skill as I still have a long road of learning ahead of me. </p>

						<h2 class="major">Personal Profile</h2>
						<p>Myers-Briggs Test Results:<br>
							CAMPAIGNER (ENFP-T)</p>
						<p>Online Learning Style Test Results:<br>
							Visual/Tactile</p>

						<p> Big Five Personality Test Results:<br>
							Openness - 71% <br>
							Conscientiousness - 54% <br>
							Extraversion - 81%<br>
							Agreeableness - 77%<br>
							Neuroticism - 62.5% <br></p>

						<h3> What do I think these results mean for me? </h3>
						<p> I believe these results show I use emotions to my advantage when possible and that I would choose someones feelings over a logical decision
							alot of the time. I feel these results outline myself as an open accepting and aware person with good a intention and learns best visually.</p>
						<h3> How these results could effect my behaviour in a team?</h3>
						<p>These results show that I am open to opinions from others and am understanding of their views and goals. It is important that I
							don't let myself get pushed around and have my understanding taken advantage off. </p>
						<h3> How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
						<p> I should pick like-minded team members and set ground rules early on as to how ideas are pitched and spoken about. Establishing a toxic-free enviorment
							is crucial for my own success and in my opion the success of my team.</p>

					<h3> reducing the red light </h3>
					<section class="features">

						<a href="#" class="image"><img src="https://www.star2.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/str2_scitraffic1505_py_1-770x470.jpg" alt="" /></a>
						<br>

						<<p>Everywhere I drive today I notice a continuous inefficiency when it comes to traffic lights. Too often am I waiting at a red light whilst there are no cars currently using the intersections,
							This is an extremely frustrating thing that happens often every day I drive. I believe we have the technology to radically improve the average wait time and minimize the time that cars are stagnant with the intersection being empty.
							<br><br>
							With over 19.2 million registered motor vehicles on the road in Australia as of January 2018, it is apparent that even a tiny increment of improvement could prove a massive gain for all drivers. Not only would more efficient
							intersections allow drivers to travel from point A to point B, it would also have a secondary effect of reducing traffic congestion with a more continuous flow of traffic. An important 3rd effect worth mentioning would be the positive
							benefits for the environment, less time with engines running equals less overall pollution. It would even be possible to engineer these lights to prevent drivers from slowing down in short distances in an attempt to preserve more
							kinetic energy decreasing emissions even further. It is possible that such a technology would reduce road rage and car incidents which could even go on to prevent injury or death in a motor vehicle.
							<br><br>
							There are many ways we could develop traffic lights to operate more efficiently depending on the goal. Let's say our goal is to reduce the amount of time the intersection is underutilized and cars are sitting idling with no one
							crossing. Now we can set some basic principles for this to be a functional adaptation in society.
							<br><br>
							1. It must be able to integrate with current light systems as an add on to make it feasible.<br>
							2. It must operate similar enough to current light technologies for an easy transition for drivers<br>
							3. There must be at least 1 redundancy if the software/system fails for any reason.<br>
							4. It must be simple enough that drivers do not need to learn how it works.<br>
							<br>
							Adopting a vehicle recognition system would be a feasible option. Adding several cameras to an intersection that are able to determine the size and speed of a vehicle, where it is trying to go, and how it relates to the other cars. Once
							a way of analyzing the vehicles is created the possibilities are endless, the software could even come in several iterations. <br>
							<br>
							Using a logical process of development I can see the software coming out in stages loosely as follows with realistically endless possibilities and new iterations.
							<br><br>
							-Establishing a system that closes empty lanes and opens occupied ones.
							<br><br>
							-Then letting this system prioritize lanes with the highest either occupied cars or potential throughput.
							<br><br>
							-Once these two basic functions are working we could move on to more advanced techniques such as spotting a large vehicle in the distance for example a semi truck, and then try to priorise its path to prevent the truck stop which can
							save a lot
							of emissions from the trucks wasted energy breaking and accelerating.


							<br><br>
							It would be safe to say that the tools and technologies for something of this relatively small scale are already global and would not require any real breakthroughs or new developments. This is more focusing on using technology that
							developers and engineers are already comfortable and knowledgeable to improve the way traffic lights function. Traffic lights like many things on the road are a tool, a tool that hasn't seen improvement in decades and it is time for
							someone to revolutionise them. I think it's worth mentioning the inevitable future of self-driving cars as it could be argued that this type of improvement would be negligible once self-driving cars are brought into the mainstream. It
							would be fair to say that a global dominance of self-driving cars is still several decades away and even further away from a country of full autonomously without traffic lights road lines or other indicators. For now traffic lights,
							stop signs, road lines etc. are all tools designed for humans to work okay. But We should strive to improve these tools as much as possible for the benefits of everyone.</p>
